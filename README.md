# DANA-4830-Project
TCGA - BRCA - Classification

Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases affecting individuals worldwide. This study aims to classify breast cancer stages by examining gene expression variations and predicting patient survival likelihood using transcriptomic data. By leveraging mRNA-seq gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the project will identify key biomarkers for early detection and explore gene-gene interactions influencing cancer progression. A combination of normalization techniques, feature selection methods, and machine learning models will be employed to develop an optimized classification system, with a final goal of integrating survival analysis into a predictive dashboard for clinical insights.
